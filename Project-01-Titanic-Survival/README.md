📌 Project 01: Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning)

🔍 Problem Statement

The Titanic disaster is one of the most well-known shipwrecks in history. During its maiden voyage, the RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, leading to the loss of many lives.

The objective of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not based on given passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and family details.

This is a binary classification problem, where:

1 → Passenger survived

0 → Passenger did not survive

🎯 Objective

To build a machine learning model that learns patterns from historical passenger data and predicts survival outcomes for unseen passengers.

🧠 Why Machine Learning?

Survival on the Titanic depended on multiple interacting factors such as:

Gender
Passenger class
Age
Family size
Fare paid

These relationships are not linear or rule-based, making machine learning a suitable approach to automatically learn patterns from data and make predictions.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the Kaggle Titanic Dataset, which consists of:

train.csv → Used for training and evaluation

test.csv → Used for final predictions

Target Variable:

Survived (0 or 1)

⚙️ Approach

The project follows a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow:
